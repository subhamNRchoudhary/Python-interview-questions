*Set Function*

  ( What is a set type in Python? )
  
 	 Pythonâ€™s built-in set type has the following characteristics: Sets are unordered. Set elements are unique. Duplicate elements are not allowed. A set itself may be modified, 	but the elements contained in the set 
  	must be of an immutable type.

# Python3 program for explaining
# use of list, tuple, set and 
# dictionary

# Lists
	l = []

# Adding Element into the list
	l.append(5)
	l.append(10)
	print("Adding 5 and 10 in list", l)

# Popping Elements from the list
	l.pop()
	print("Popped one element from list", l)
	print()

# Set
	s = set()

# Adding element into the set
	s.add(5)
	s.add(10)
	print("Adding 5 and 10 in set", s)

# Removing element from set
	s.remove(5)
	print("Removing 5 from set", s)
	print()

# Tuple
	t = tuple(l)

# Tuples are immutable
	print("Tuple", t)
	print()

# Dictionary
	d = {}

# Adding the key-value pair
	d[5] = "Five"
	d[10] = "Ten"
	print("Dictionary", d)

# Removing key-value pair
	del d[10]
	print("Dictionary", d)

Tuples:

Syntax: ()
	Ordered: Yes (Maintains the insertion order)
 
	Mutable: No (Elements cannot be changed once assigned)

### 1. **What are the different data types in Python?**
   Python has various built-in data types, including:
   - **int** (Integer)
   - **float** (Floating point number)
   - **str** (String)
   - **list** (Mutable collection of items)
   - **tuple** (Immutable collection of items)
   - **dict** (Key-value pairs, mutable)
   - **set** (Unordered, unique collection of items)

### 2. **What is the difference between mutable and immutable objects in Python?**
   - **Mutable objects**: Can be changed after their creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets).
   - **Immutable objects**: Cannot be changed once created (e.g., strings, tuples, integers).

### 3. **How does Python manage memory?**
   Python handles memory through its **memory manager**, which allocates memory to objects. Python also uses a **garbage collector** to remove objects that are no longer in use (using reference counting and cyclic garbage collection).

### 4. **What is the difference between a normal function and a lambda function in Python?**
   - **Normal function**: Defined using `def` and can have a block of multiple statements.
   - **Lambda function**: A short, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword, typically for single-line expressions.
   
   Example:  
   `def add(x, y): return x + y`  
   `lambda x, y: x + y`

### 5. **What are global, local, and nonlocal variables in Python?**
   - **Global variables**: Defined outside any function, accessible anywhere in the code.
   - **Local variables**: Defined inside a function, accessible only within that function.
   - **Nonlocal variables**: Used in nested functions to refer to variables from the nearest enclosing scope (excluding global scope).
   
   The `global` and `nonlocal` keywords are used to refer to variables outside the current scope.

### 6. **Explain Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.**
   - **Inheritance**: Allows a class to inherit properties from another class.
   - **Polymorphism**: Enables using a single interface to represent different types of objects.
   - **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (variables) and methods that work on the data into a single unit (class).
   - **Abstraction**: Hiding internal implementation details and exposing only necessary functionalities.

### 7. **What are decorators in Python?**
   Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function or class. They are applied using the `@decorator` syntax. Decorators are commonly used for tasks like logging, access control, and memoization.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   @decorator_function
   def some_function():
       pass
   ```

### 8. **What are generators and iterators in Python?**
   - **Iterator**: An object that implements the iterator protocol (`__iter__` and `__next__` methods).
   - **Generator**: A special type of iterator created using the `yield` keyword, which allows values to be returned one at a time.

   Example:
   ```python
   def simple_generator():
       yield 1
       yield 2
       yield 3
   ```

### 9. **What are list comprehensions, and why are they used?**
   List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or iterables. They are faster and require fewer lines of code compared to loops.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
   ```

### 10. **How does Python handle exceptions?**
   Exceptions are handled using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. Python raises exceptions during runtime errors, and they can be caught and handled to prevent program termination.

   Example:
   ```python
   try:
       1 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Cannot divide by zero")
   finally:
       print("End of block")
   ```

### 11. **What are modules and packages in Python?**
   - **Module**: A single Python file containing functions, classes, or variables.
   - **Package**: A collection of modules organized in directories with an `__init__.py` file.

   Example:  
   Importing a module: `import math`  
   Importing a function from a module: `from math import sqrt`

### 12. **What is a virtual environment in Python, and why is it used?**
   A virtual environment isolates Python dependencies for different projects. This prevents conflicts between package versions used in different projects.

   To create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

### 13. **What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?**
   The GIL is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute at a time, even in a multi-threaded application. This affects the performance of CPU-bound tasks in multi-threading but not I/O-bound tasks.

### 14. **How is file handling done in Python?**
   Python uses built-in functions to handle files, such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`. Files can be opened in modes like `r` (read), `w` (write), and `a` (append).

   Example:
   ```python
   with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
       content = file.read()
   ```

### 15. **What is the difference between multi-threading and multi-processing in Python?**
   - **Multi-threading**: Involves multiple threads running within a single process (limited by the GIL).
   - **Multi-processing**: Involves multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space, bypassing the GIL.

### 16. **What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python?**
   - **Shallow copy**: Creates a new object but doesn't recursively copy nested objects.
   - **Deep copy**: Recursively copies all objects, including nested ones.
   
   The `copy` module provides `copy()` (shallow) and `deepcopy()` (deep).

### 17. **What causes memory leaks in Python, and how can they be avoided?**
   Memory leaks occur when objects are not properly garbage-collected due to circular references or keeping references to unused objects. Using weak references (`weakref` module) and careful resource management can prevent memory leaks.

### 18. **What are dunder (magic) methods in Python?**
   Dunder methods are special methods with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__add__`) that define the behavior of objects. They allow customizing object creation, representation, arithmetic operations, etc.

   Example:  
   `__str__` defines the string representation of an object.

### 19. **What are context managers, and how are they implemented in Python?**
   Context managers ensure proper acquisition and release of resources using the `with` statement. The `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods are used to define behavior when entering and exiting a context.

   Example:
   ```python
   with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
       content = f.read()
   ```

### 20. **What are metaclasses in Python?**
   Metaclasses define the behavior of classes themselves (classes are instances of metaclasses). They can be used to customize class creation, modify class attributes, or enforce design patterns.

   Example:
   ```python
   class Meta(type):
       def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
           return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
   ```


	
	b = minimum_value(a)
	print('min:', b)
