Set Function
  ( What is a set type in Python? ) 
  Pythonâ€™s built-in set type has the following characteristics: Sets are unordered. Set elements are unique. Duplicate elements are not allowed. A set itself may be modified, but the elements contained in the set 
  must be of an immutable type.

The Difference between List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e0de444-b7b2-4547-96e0-03ea62328524)

# Python3 program for explaining
# use of list, tuple, set and 
# dictionary

# Lists
	l = []

# Adding Element into the list
	l.append(5)
	l.append(10)
	print("Adding 5 and 10 in list", l)

# Popping Elements from the list
l.pop()
print("Popped one element from list", l)
print()

# Set
s = set()

# Adding element into the set
s.add(5)
s.add(10)
print("Adding 5 and 10 in set", s)

# Removing element from set
s.remove(5)
print("Removing 5 from set", s)
print()

# Tuple
t = tuple(l)

# Tuples are immutable
print("Tuple", t)
print()

# Dictionary
d = {}

# Adding the key-value pair
d[5] = "Five"
d[10] = "Ten"
print("Dictionary", d)

# Removing key-value pair
del d[10]
print("Dictionary", d)

Lists:

Syntax: []
Ordered: Yes (Maintains the insertion order)
Mutable: Yes (Elements can be changed)
Duplicates: Yes (Allows duplicate elements)
Example: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Tuples:

Syntax: ()
Ordered: Yes (Maintains the insertion order)
Mutable: No (Elements cannot be changed once assigned)
Duplicates: Yes (Allows duplicate elements)
Example: (1, 2, 3, 4)
Sets:

Syntax: {} or set()
Ordered: No (No guarantee of order in Python versions before 3.7)
Mutable: Yes (Elements can be added or removed)
Duplicates: No (Does not allow duplicate elements)
Example: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Dictionaries:

Syntax: {key: value}
Ordered: Yes (Maintains the insertion order starting from Python 3.7)
Mutable: Yes (Keys and values can be changed)
Duplicates: No (Keys must be unique, but values can be duplicated)
Example: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
